    <t>I have a Substack now, which I intend to use as a drafting site for my more polished work. Click <a href="https://clallen.substack.com/">here</a>to read it.
    <t>From 2023-2025, I served as the cofounding editorial director for Scaffold* Journal, a process-oriented research journal working in disciplines of design and visual inquiry. That work, continued by my friends and collaborators at the John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design, can be found <a href= "https://scaffold.cargo.site/">here</a>.</t>
