        <p> Hello and welcome! My name is Claire Allen, and I am a writer and researcher spending most of my time scrolling towards a digital-subcultural underground. This developing practice subsists through intra- and extra-institutional study, lurking, categorizing things, making lists, trying to learn actually how computers work, and attempting to document information via ephemera passing through the digital commons. </p>
        <p>In 2025, I completed my HBA at the John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto, where I focused my work in critical practices relating to popular visual culture and visual rhetoric. My undergraduate thesis researched contemporary girlblogging subcultures on Instagram, arguing for their placement within a canon of looking shaped by the male gaze and succeeding such fine artistic media as painting, photography, and film. That, and other scholarly projects of mine, can be found <a href= "./slog.html">here</a>. Other writings of mine can be found <a href= "./blog.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Outside of these more serious endeavours I also find myself a collector of cultural detritus, especially in digital spaces. This collection can be found <a href= "./log.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>You can also find me on Instagram (evil evil!) at <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/cllallenbot/#">@cllallenbot</a>.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading. Glhf!</p>
